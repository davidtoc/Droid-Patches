### My First Droid Patch - Fixed Interval Harmony
###
### Requires a P2B8
### 
### Input pitch CV into I1
### Output new pitch to O1
### P1.1 will add to the output pitch in a discrete multiple of semitones 
### from 0-13 (ie. unison to Octave)
### 
### By putting the original signal as well as the new signal from O1 into VCOs,
### you can create a fixed interval harmony (or change the interval over time
### by turning P1.


[p2b8]

[copy] # copy value from Input 1, add interval, output to Output 1
    input = I1 + _SEMITONES
    output = O1

[pot]
    output = _SEMITONES
    discrete = 13  # 13 discrete possible outputs from 0-13
    pot = P1.1
    outputscale = 0.0833V # multiply discrete value by 1 semitone (1/12 octave = .08333v)
